    \section{Pseudocode}
    Computer needs very specific and clear instructions in order to run correctly.
    Computer itself can only recognize one kind of instruction, which is the
    machine code that consists of 0s and 1s. Since it is very difficult for human
    beings to read binary code, we designed assembly language.
