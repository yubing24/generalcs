\section{Standard I/O}
There are many ways that you and your computer communicate with each other. For
example, when your program prints out message in the console, it is a form of
output. When your program is reading your input, it is a form of input. A typical
computer system usually receives inputs as a stream of characters, and generates
outputs in a similar form. This is called standard I/O.

Many operating systems support this standard I/O.
