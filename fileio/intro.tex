    \section {Introduction}
    File and file system are one of the most important aspects of a computer and
    operating system. File system is a mechanism that allows data to be saved
    in non-volatile storage media, such as magnetic tape and disk, and many
    applications that we use today heavily involve with file input/output. This
    chapter will introduce the basic concepts of file and file system and how
    to interact with files using the C$\sharp$ programming langauge.
