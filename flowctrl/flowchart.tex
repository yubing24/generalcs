    \section{Flowchart}
    Flowchart is a very useful skill that can help programmers understand what
    they need to achieve in their code. Flowchart is not part of programming, but
    can be very helpful. When you are reading other programmers' code and trying
    to understand what their programs are doing, drawing a flowchart can often
    reduce the time you spend on reading the code.
