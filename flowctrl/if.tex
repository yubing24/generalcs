    \section{If Statement}
Sometimes program needs to make a decision, just like human beings. For example,
you want to figure out if a movie is old. You probably want your program work
like this:


read movie data
    if (produced before 1950):
        print (``It's an old movie!'')


Many programming languages offer a statement that allows program to choose an
execution path based on a condition. This is the if statement.

In C\#, an if statement code block looks like this:

\lstset{language=Java}
\begin{lstlisting}
    if (<condition>)
    {
        <statement #1>;
        <statement #2>;
        ...
    }
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=Pascal}




The `\textless condition \textgreater' expression should always evaluate to a
boolean value: true or false.
