    \section{Chapter Introduction}
So far, you have learned how to write programs that read some inputs from user
and print some information out. However, it is rather primitive if we want to
make a bit more complex program. For example, if we want to write a program that
can read a number and tell if that number is positive, negative, or zero, we
won't be able to do that yet. Thus we need some mechanism that can allow us to
change the execution path of program in accordance to user's input.
