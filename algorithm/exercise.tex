    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Do you think the naive algorithm of sorting efficient? Why or why
        not? Look up some other sorting algorithms and see if you can find
        any other algorithm that are efficient?
        \item Is it easier to find items in a sorted collection or unsorted? Why
        or why not?
        \item How is the efficiency of an algorithm measured?
    \end{enumerate}
