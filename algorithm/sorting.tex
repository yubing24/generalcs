    \section{Sorting}
    Many problem can be solved easily once items are sorted. For example, finding
    the card Heart J is much easier in a sorted set of cards than unsorted. It is
    likely that you may get lucky with unsorted cards since the first card is
    Heart J, but most of the time you need to look up every single card in an
    unsorted set of cards to find out which one is Heart J. However, for a sorted
    set of cards, all you need to find out is where Heart cards are, and use that
    to find out where Heart J is.

    There are a variety of items that can be sorted: numbers, alphabetic letters,
    poker cards, etc. For a particular item, there are many attibute to sort by.
    For example, a group of people can be sorted by their heights, last name,
    first name, or the address they live in. For a particular sort, such as sorting
    people by their heights, there are also a variety ways of sort them. Computer
    science studies the efficient way of sorting a particular thing to a particular
    order. This section introduces two basic sorting algorithm: insertion sort
    and selection sort. However, there are more efficient sorting algorithm out
    there, including heap sort, merge sort, and quick sort, and you will learn
    them from a more advanced level course.
