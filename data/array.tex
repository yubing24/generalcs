\section{Array}
\begin{document}
    Array is a data structure that allows a certain number of values that have
    the same type stored and accessed together. Array is one of the most useful
    and important data structure in computer science, as it is used to implement
    other more sophisticated data structures such as list, heap, and set. This
    book does not introduce the implementation of any of these data structures
    other than how to use them.

    Array is a reference type, meaning that the variable name in a program is
    simply a reference that points to somewhere else in computer memory that
    actually stores the value of each value. In an array, each value is called
    as an \emph{element}.

    Generally, array is 0 indexed, meaning that the first item for us is the
    zeroth item for computer.
