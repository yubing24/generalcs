\section{Structure}

Struct, as known as structure, is a composition of data. For example, all
laptops have brand and price. If we have 5 kinds of laptop, then we would need
to have 5 string variables from their names and 5 integer variables for their
prices. This can be difficult to manage. However, with struct, we can easily
represent such data relationship in a program.

In C$\sharp$, a struct is declared like this:

\begin{minted}{csharp}
    public struct Laptop
    {
        public string brand;
        public int price;
    }
\end{minted}

A struct declaration usually contains these statements:

\begin{minted}{csharp}
    public struct <identifier>
    {
        public <type> <member identifier>;
        public <type> <member identifier>;
        ...
    }
\end{minted}

If we have a laptop of which brand is ``Boat'' and price is 500, we can use the
structure above to represent such laptop like this:

\begin{minted}{csharp}
    Laptop boat; // declare this variable
    boat.brand = "Boat"; // Initialize its brand
    boat.price = 500; // Initialize its price
\end{minted}

As you can tell, if you want to access the member of a structure, just use the
dot operator (``.'') after the variable identifier, and followed by the variable
identifier of the field. For example:

\begin{minted}{csharp}
    Console.WriteLine (boat.brand + ": " + boat.price);
\end{minted}
