\section{Introduction}
Data structure is one of the most important topic in computer science. Many
innovation of computer software comes from utilizing efficient data structure in
computer programs. New data structures are usually the key that brings leaps to
the development of computer science. In many areas of computer science, finding
and efficient data structure usually can solve half of the probem of a project.
Data structure is simply reorganizing data for efficient use.

Rob Pike, one of the greatest C programmer, propose that ``Data dominates. If
you've chosen the right data structures Tnd organize things well, the algorithms
will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central
to programming.'' His quote later became one of the Unix philosophy in Eric
Raymond's \emph{The Art of UNIX Programming}.

This chapter will introduce following basic data structures: structure, enumeration,
array, list, queue, and stack.
