    \section{Using Git to Manage Code}
    Git is a very useful tool for managing programs. It is firstly written by
    Linus Torvalds in 1990s, and today it is the most popularly used version
    control program among software developers.

    There are two good sites for managing your program on a remote server: GitHub
    and BitBucket.

    GitHub is a good choice if you decide to make all your work publicly available,
    while BitBucket is good for those projects that are required remaining private
    and not open to anyone but those who have privilege to view your repository.
