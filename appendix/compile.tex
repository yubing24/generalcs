\chapter{Compile \csharp Program}

\subsection{Ubuntu Linux}
For users whose primary operating system is Ubuntu Linux, the default \csharp
compiler is the one implemented by Mono. To invoke this compiler and compile
your program, simply type:

\texttt{\$ mcs program.cs}

This will generate an executable file named \texttt{program.exe}. You can run
this program by typing:

\texttt{\$ ./program.exe}

If this does not execute the program, then you have two ways to do:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Change the file to executable by using the \texttt{chmod +x} shell script.
    \item Using Mono runtime environment to run this program: \texttt{mono program.exe}.
\end{enumerate}
Either way would work.
