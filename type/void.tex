    \section{Void}
    There is a special type in many programming languages, and this type is
    \texttt{void}. Technically, a \texttt{void} type is not a type, since it is
    impossible to declare a variable that has a type \texttt{void} in \csharp.
    However, \texttt{void} is still very important, especially in languages such
    as C and C++, where a pointer of \texttt{void} type is heavily used in programming.

    So far, the only situation that we would use \texttt{void} type is in
    declaring the \texttt{Main ()} method:
    \begin{minted}{csharp}
    using System;
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main (string [] args)
        {
            // Put statements here.
        }
    }
    \end{minted}
\end{document}
