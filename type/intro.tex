\section{Introduction}
\begin{document}
This chapter introduces the concept of variable and basic type system. Type system
is a way of categorizing data that we use inside a computer. By putting data into
different kind of categories, programming can be much easier and efficient. By
allowing data of differnt type be cast to others, programming can be more flexible
and creative, too. This chapter starts from some basic idea of computer memory
structure, then jump into variables and types. Types introduced in this chapter
are mostly primitive types (integer, double, and character).
