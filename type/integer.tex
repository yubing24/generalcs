    \section{Integer}
Integers are values that does not have fractional components. Examples of
integers are: 0, -99, 10201022, etc. For any computer, the amount of integer
that it can represent is limited. For a 64-bit computer, the maximum integer it
can represent is 2<sup>64</sup> - 1 (minus 1 because it starts from 0 instead of 1).
